in Client you can run it and pick either play_blackjack_without_solana or blackjack_using_solana by simply clicking on it

play_blackjack_without_solana.py - is very basic, you just play with a dealer without any money. jsut to have some fun. It uses randomise so you do not have less chances to win/ dealer and you have same chances to win 

If you want to play with dealer with the money use -- blackjack_using_solana.py
1) download solathon by vpasting this in the console: 

pip install solathon

2) download phantom to your chrome https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/phantom/bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhpkkoljpa
3) deposit sol from any exchanges 
4) make sure you have 2 wallets - one for the player and one for the dealer (i'm not providing the dealers money)
5) make sure dealer has 2 times more money for what you want to play (dealer keeps 5% every round as a commision.)

6) Last but not least, do not forget about the fees; it's blockchain and it uses fees as proccessing your transactions so validators can  eat/ I've putted the most lowest fee which is around 0.000005 SOL. 

7) If solana network has any  congestions just simply try again/ you use the most lowest fees so your transaction can not go through!

GOOD LUCK AND DO NOT PLAY FOR A LOT OF SOL
